        What's an Abstract Class?

If you want the power of polymorphism without the work

abstract public class Creature

public abstract void setName();

There are no abstract fields

All methods don't have to be abstract

You can have static methods




                What's an interface
A class with only abstract methods

You can add as many interfaces to a class using implements as you want

You can only use public static and final fields

interfaces provide the ultimate in flexibility

classes from different inheritance trees can use a common interface
